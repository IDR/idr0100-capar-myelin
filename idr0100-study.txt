Study Title	A Multi-Spectral Myelin Annotation Tool for Machine Learning Based Myelin Quantification

Study Type	myelination

Study Type Term Accession	GO_0042552										
Study Description	Myelin is an essential component of the nervous system and myelin damage causes demyelination diseases. Myelin is a sheet of oligodendrocyte membrane wrapped around the neuronal axon. In the fluorescent images, experts manually identify myelin by co-localization of oligodendrocyte and axonal membranes that fit certain shape and size criteria. Because myelin wriggles along x-y-z axes, machine learning is ideal for its segmentation. However, machine-learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), require a high number of annotated images, which necessitate expert labor. To facilitate myelin annotation, we developed a workflow and a software for myelin ground truth extraction from multi-spectral fluorescent images. Additionally, we shared a set of myelin ground truths annotated using this workflow.

Protocol Description	Cell differentiation and growth protocols can be accessed at Kerman et al. 2015 Development 142(12):2213-25. DOI: 10.1242/dev.116517		Cells were grown in microfluidic chambers. 	Myelinating co-cultures of oligodendrocytes and neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were incubated overnight with anti-TUJ1 and anti-MBP primary antibodies. DAPI (Sigma) was used to visualize nuclei.	Myelin was annotated using 3D Myelin Marking (CEM3D) software by 3 experts.
